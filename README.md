#InterestHub

In an era characterized by information abundance, the need for personalized recommendation systems has become paramount. The ubiquity of vast datasets, coupled with the potential of machine learning (ML) techniques, has opened avenues for creating intelligent tools that cater to individual preferences. This project introduces "InterestHub," a pioneering Model Creation Tool for Recommendation Systems, designed to empower users to construct and integrate personalized recommendation models seamlessly.

InterestHub responds to the growing demand for a user-friendly platform that not only allows the submission and integration of diverse datasets but also fosters collaboration by enabling data sharing with the public. The heart of this project lies in the implementation of Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), a state-of-the-art ML model, to construct personalized recommendation models. NCF, with its ability to capture intricate user-item interactions, forms the backbone of InterestHub, ensuring the delivery of accurate and relevant recommendations tailored to individual preferences.

This introduction sets the stage for the exploration of InterestHub, detailing its core objectives, features, and the innovative use of NCF. As we delve into the subsequent sections, a comprehensive understanding of the project's significance in the realm of recommendation systems will unfold, shedding light on its potential impact and contributions to this evolving field.
